anti-misogynist propaganda

Why should we not use the F&#k word?
=====================================

the humanistic, anti-misogynistic reason
----------------------------------------
Literally, it is a synonym for rape.  
We shouldn't treat this casually;  its something that should always be deplored.s


The logical reason
------------------
It means contradictory things.  It can mean something good, or it can mean something bad.  It can mean "very much" or it can mean "not at all"
It allows the speaker to get away with inciting rape, by allowing the listener to project whatever he wants onto it.
