anti-misogynist propaganda

Why should we not use the F&#k word?
=====================================

the humanistic, anti-misogynistic reason
----------------------------------------
Literally, it is a synonym for rape.  Sexual violence shouldn't be treated in the casual manner that we have become acculturated to.  
We shouldn't trivialize the experiences of victims by turning this into a metaphor for some kind of mental or psychic torment.


The logical reason
------------------
It means contradictory things.  It can mean something good, or it can mean something bad.  It can mean "very much" or it can mean "not at all"
It allows the speaker to get away with inciting rape, by allowing the listener to project whatever he wants onto it.
