anti-misogynist propaganda

Why should we not use the F&#k word?
=====================================

the existential reason
------------------------
Derives from understanding why we sometimes DO use it &mdash; it gives a temporary rush of elation from fantasizing of power.  However, that fantasy is empty, and addictive.   Because its a mere fantasy, you will need repetition to satisfy the craving.  On the other hand, the word could be an authentic threat, in which case it is a wicked act, and not merely a fantasy.  The power to act wickedly is ultimately degrades oneself along with the other, most people know this subconsciously, and that is why they prefer to fantasize.  

By choosing alternate word, or even silence, you will instead cultivate the authentic powers of intuitive reason and ready wit, and cultivate the virtues of language arts.

the humanistic, anti-misogynistic reason
----------------------------------------

Literally, it is a synonym for rape.  Sexual violence shouldn't be treated in the casual manner that we have become acculturated to.  
We shouldn't trivialize the experiences of victims by turning this into a metaphor for some kind of mental or psychic torment.


The logical reason
------------------
It can mean contradictory things, therefore nothing at all.  It can mean "very much" or it can mean "not at all"
It allows the speaker to get away with inciting rape, by allowing the listener to project whatever he wants onto it.
